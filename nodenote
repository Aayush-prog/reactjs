multithreaded and single threaded model

node js typical model (single threaded)

package.json
    metadata file for all npm package
    has identifier(identification of the project) and functional(instructions for npm)

event loop
    six opereations to perform specific task
    impplemented by C library
    keeps Node.js running with asynchronous operations
    cycle=>timer(executing callback settimeout and setinterval),pending callback(execute idle callback),idle prepare,poll(how long its ahould block io events,when timers should execute),check(execute callback immediately after poll),close callback(cleanup close callbacks and events)

I/O cycle
    occurs between eventloop and the backthread pool(referring to the dbs)
    setimmediate get priority in i/o cycle

anatomy of node.js module
    js file
    reusable code
    exportable and importable
    use require to import(object)
    use module.exports to export(object)
    2 types(core,3rd party,local)

creating module
    require,exports,module,__dirname,__filename(unseen parameters)
    use module.exports to export data fromthe module
    when multiple data top be exported use key value as in oject (module.export.names=['aayush','anish'])
